# C Prototypes

I find C easier to work with than Rust, not just because I'm *rusty* at Rust
(pun intended, but full disclaimer, I was never good at Rust, so I don't think
that 'rusty' is an apt description), but also because it's by default unsafe
and so it's easier to work with the raw memory that I need to for the hash table.

In `version_1`, you will find a version I tried making over the summer. I cannot
vouch for it.

In `version_2`, you will find a newer version. It doesn't work and is overly
complex, but I think it is a little simpler than the previous version. I will
have to refactor it to make it closer to the Python version.

NEITHER OF THESE IMPLEMENTATIONS WORK!
